# week-4-game
This is Game of Thrones themed role playing game.  Choose your character to start the game, but consider carefully how you choose.  The character's life meter is shown at the bottom of his card, but each character also an attack and counter attack power meter that is not shown.
Once your character has been selected, choose an enemy.  You need to also choose your enemy wisely since your character's attack power increases throughout the fight, therefore becoming stronger.
To attack the selected enemy, push the attack button repeatedly until either your character or the enemy is dead.  If your character survives, you can chose another enemy, and so on until all enemies are defeated and you're the last one standing.
